## Module Explanation:
This module allows Greenify to function as a system-integrated (privileged) app without modifying the ROM, enabling Boost Mode. It optimizes hibernation performance beyond the standard root option by injecting the APK into /system/priv-app. If the app appears as "Privileged" in the settings, the setup is complete.

Note: 
- Follow [mm recovery module](https://github.com/Rikj000/Magisk-Manager-for-Recovery-Mode/releases) instructions in case of bootloop to disable/remove this module.
- Custom MIUI mod ROMs (EU, VN, PL) might require latest DFE.

### If after installing this module in KSU and rebooting, the Greenify app won't open, DisableUmount modules by default in KSU Settings, or just download the APK, then install and overwrite it.
