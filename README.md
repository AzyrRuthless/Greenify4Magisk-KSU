* This module was originally created by [Abacate123](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6439974) but was deprecated. I am simply continuing his work.


## Module Explanation:
A very simple module just to make Greenify work as a rom-integrated (privileged) app systemlessly (also known as Boost Mode), so you'll achieve the best hibernating performance it could give, and faster than using the root option only. It'll simply inject a folder with the apk into the path: /system/priv-app. If it shows Privileged at the app settings, then you're good.

* Note: You won't get any xposed-side features, since magisk is NOT xposed!

## Requirements: 
- Android 5.0 - 9.0.0
- Magisk v18.0+

## Changelog?:
* Initial build
* Greenify app version V4.6.3(BETA)

## About the apk:
* Apk downloaded directly from [APKMirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oasis-feng/greenify/ "Greenify's APKMirror page"), **original and not tampered in any way**.

## Installation:
* This module already has the latest apk inside, just download one of zips from the mirror and install through the Magisk Manager app or TWRP. As simple as that.

## How to remove:
* You can simply flash the same zip again to remove the module, or you can remove through the Magisk Manager "modules" section as well.
